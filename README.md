# Weather Image Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for the paper "Real-Time Weather Image Classification with SVM: A Feature-Based Approach". The project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify weather conditions in images into four categories: rainy, low light, haze, and clear.

## Features
- Brightness
- Saturation
- Noise Level
- Blur Metric
- Edge Strength
- Motion Blur
- Local Binary Patterns (LBP) mean and variance for radii 1, 2, and 3
- Edges mean and variance
- Color histogram mean and variance for blue, green, and red channels

## Results
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 92.8%, surpassing typical benchmarks for classical machine learning methods.
